*Over the past decades, asteroseismology has been established as one of the most powerful tools to study stars and exoplanets in our galaxy. With TESS well into its second extended mission, this workshop will celebrate the ongoing successes from the exploration of Kepler/K2 and TESS data, and discuss future challenges and opportunities. Expected topics broadly include asteroseismology/stellar astrophysics, exoplanet science and galactic astronomy.*

----

The workshop will take place from 17-21 July 2023 at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa campus in Honolulu, Hawaiʻi. Participation will be possible online and in-person.

----

The TASC7/KASC14 workshop will be dedicated to the celebration of the 60th birthday of Hans Kjeldsen, one of the founders of the Kepler/TESS Asteroseismic Science Consortium.
